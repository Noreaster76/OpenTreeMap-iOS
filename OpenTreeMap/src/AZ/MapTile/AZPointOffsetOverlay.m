     A comment from https://github.com/mtigas/iOS-MapLayerDemo

     "The Google Mercator projection is slightly off from the "standard" Mercator projection, used by MapKit. My understanding is that this is due to Google Maps' use of a Spherical Mercator projection, where the poles are cut off -- the effective map ending at approx. +/- 85ยบ. MapKit does not(?), therefore, our origin point (top-left) must be moved accordingly."
